Nice, you've found my Github Profile. This is the place where I will document my journey through different kinds of technologies.
Buckle up, it's going to be a messy ride. Well, someday it will be. Currently I am a Fulltime Software Engineer. I love to work with Flutter as you might
have guessed from my repos. But I really try to stay up to date and try different technologies.
I really enjoy tinkering with Ardiuno and connecting IOT-Devices with a Flutter Frontend. For now thats about it.
